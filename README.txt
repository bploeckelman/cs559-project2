To run this program, use visual studio to open the cs559-project2.vcxproj file.
You should not need to edit anything for the command line options.
Just click build all and run without debugging.

A window should pop up with some control points defined and one of the control
 points highlighted with 3 smaller cubes drawn by it.

If you click on the animate button, the three smaller cubes orbit the
 highlighted control point. If you click the animate button again, the
 animation stops.

You can change which control point is highlighted by using the mouse.

If no control point is clicked then there is no selection made and all the
 control points are the base (unselected color)

There should also be a console output window that gives you the point location
 of any control point you click on in an (x,y,z) format.

The console output also displays if you click on somewhere in the drawing
 window that is not a control point.
